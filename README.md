# CSS Specificity and !important Issues

This repository demonstrates common issues related to CSS specificity and the overuse of the `!important` flag.

## Bug Description

Unexpected CSS specificity can lead to styles not applying as intended.  The `!important` flag, while useful in certain cases, can make CSS hard to maintain if overused.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining and structuring CSS rules to avoid conflicts, and judiciously using the `!important` flag only when absolutely necessary.  We should prefer a more organized approach to styling, potentially using CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less to better manage specificity and maintainability.
