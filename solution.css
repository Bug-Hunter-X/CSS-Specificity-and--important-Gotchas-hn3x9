A better approach to solving specificity issues is to use more specific CSS selectors. For example, instead of:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

You could use:

```css
.specific-div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

This way, the specificity is improved, making the styles less prone to conflicts. Also, avoid `!important` as much as possible. If you must use it, try to understand why it's necessary, so you can fix the underlying CSS conflict instead of just masking it.
